# extended-numbers
Extended-numbers is a module for showing big numbers shortened with abbreviations such as "k", "M", and so on.  Supports negative numbers, addition and substraction, and custom abbreviations. Enjoy. 

Default abbreviations: k, M, B, T

PD: I will probably change precision to a class variable since having one precision value for each instance is pretty weird imo and not the best way to go. You can overwrite it until I officially release one update myself.
